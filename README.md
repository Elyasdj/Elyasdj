<p>
  I’m not your average “just-graduated” engineer. <br>
  I break things just to fix them better. I automate what bores me. <br>
  And I’ve learned the best lessons in tech come from the logs no one reads.
</p>

<h2>🚧 Currently hacking around with</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Linux 🐧 (my daily driver)</li>
  <li>Docker & Compose 🐳 (containers are cool, period.)</li>
  <li>GitLab CI/CD ♾️🔄 (because automation > manual)</li>
  <li>SolarWinds & Cacti 👀 (been there, monitored that. Monitoring isn’t optional)</li>
  <li>Kubernetes & Ansible ☸️🅰️ (get ready for my arrival worms...)</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ I like</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Solving problems no one wants to touch.</li>
  <li>Making broken systems run like butter.</li>
  <li>Turning “it works on my machine” into “it scales in prod.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Moral Code</h2>
<blockquote>
  “Every weird bug is just a misunderstood feature.”
</blockquote>

<p>or when I’m tired :</p>

<blockquote>
  “If it ain't monitored, it doesn't exist.”
</blockquote>

<p>Thoughts I didn’t rm -rf over the years :</p>

<ul>
  <li> “There is no price to perfection, only an end to pursuit.”</li>
  <li> “It’s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.”</li>
  <li> “With great power also comes great responsibility.”</li>
</ul>
